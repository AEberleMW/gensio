.TH greflector 1 01/02/19  "A program for reflecting data to all connected"

.SH NAME
greflector \- A program that will reflect data to all connections

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B greflector [-c] [-t] <gensio accepter>

.SH DESCRIPTION
The

program accepts gensio connections on the given accepter.  For all
connections, if data comes in, it will send that data out to all other
connections.

This is useful for debugging.  For instance, if you wanted to simulate
an AX25 KISS TNC connection and the air connecting them, and you wanted to
observe the data, you could do:
.IP
$ greflector -t kiss,tcp,1234
.PP
