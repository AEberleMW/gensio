This directory holds tests for gensio.  Note that there are also
extensive tests in ser2net.  These tests are more basic and
functional.

These tests require the linux serial simulation module in
linux-serialsim in this package.  You must load that module and the
user running the test must be able to access the serial ports
(generally you must be in the dialout group).

Fuzz testing is also available for some of the filter gensios, see the
makefile for details on what is available.  These tests work by
running a standard scenario and saving the data written to the
accepting gensio, then using that as input for the afl fuzz tester.
There's quite a bit of setup involved, but the afl program will tell
you what is wrong and how to fix it.
